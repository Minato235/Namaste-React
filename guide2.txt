Episode 4=>
props-passing arguments to functions
config-driven Ui-we can config ui depends on location(city,county etc)
always use map and keep key in map(react index is bad practice)
virtual dom-is not real dom its a representaion of dom
reconliation uses diff algo and compares virtual dom and acutal dom then updates what need to be changed and 
just updates  and renders that part  not all
why we use keys?=>suppose we have 4 div without keys then we put 5th div react renders everything,
we we keep keys then react renders only th div
Tree-virtual representaion(ex:html)
diff algo=>
react fiber;

export->we can do multiple componenets {}
import=>we only do default i mean 1;
we can do both default and import same time Header,{Title}
